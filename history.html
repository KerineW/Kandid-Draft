		<h2>The History of Kandid</h2></div>

		<p> 
			<em>KANDID</em>, which is short for <em><strong>K</em></strong>erine <em><strong>AND</em></strong> <em><strong>I</em></strong>mani <em><strong>D</em></strong>anielle,
			was birthed in January after being requested by our high school I.T teacher. 
			She believed we had the creative mindset and skill to execute this task she had put before us - a compilation of pictures of herself as a wedding anniversary gift to her dear husband.
			We accepted this challenge immediately. This opportunity was a clear sign that we had the skill and talent that had to be exposed. 
			It was also the first time fully working with my best friend Kerine. 
			After this experience (which was a success by the way), we both realize that we had revealed certain skills no one knew about. The mother of our teacher was so impressed with our professionalism and creativity and that she strongly suggested that we start thinking about plans for a business. This was ammunition to boost our thoughts in seriously starting a photography business.
			Thanks to Kerine, the name "KANDID" was initiated. We took it upon ourselves to do random and sometimes avant-garde photo shoots to build on our portfolio and our skill of course. We’ve been approached with little jobs after, just to capture moments at events like Social Interaction Day, Sixth Form Concert and the 6th form Cocktail Party. 
			Naturally, people began noticing us and we eventually started to get REAL professional jobs like Weddings, Parties and in recent times, a 3-day high school reunion. We’re happy to say that we are growing, but this is all for the fun as well as developing our skill as photographers. We strive to keep it at a professional level and execute it to the highest level. We hope to expand and grow as a business and also build on our friendship. 
			We love what we do and it is our passion that keeps us going as a business.
